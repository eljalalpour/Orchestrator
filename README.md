# Orchestrator

This repository implements the Orchestrator of FTC to deploy, monitor, and recover a chain of middleboxes. FTC is
a protocol to provide fault tolerance for a chain of middleboxes.
For more information about this protocol please refer to our paper [[1]](#1)

Orchestrator contains two modules. First, the Orchestrater (can be found [here](src/main/java/org/Orchestrator))
which deploys andmonitor a chain of middleboxes. In addition, it initiates the failure recovery procedure when
a middlebox fails.
Second, the Agent runs a service at a host to communicate with the orchstrator (accessable from [here](src/main/java/org/Agent)).

# Orchestrator

This repository implements the Orchestrator of Fault Tolerant service function Chaining (FTC) system to deploy, monitor, and recover a chain of middleboxes. FTC provides fault tolerance for a chain of middleboxes. For more information refer to our paper [[1]](#1)

Orchestrator contains two modules. First, the Orchestrater (can be found [here](src/main/java/org/Orchestrator))
which deploys andmonitor a chain of middleboxes. In addition, it initiates the failure recovery procedure when
a middlebox fails.
Second, the Agent runs a service at a host to communicate with the orchstrator (accessable from [here](src/main/java/org/Agent)).
